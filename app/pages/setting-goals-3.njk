      <h1>Personal goal</h1>
      <p>Now set a goal that is meaningful to you.</p>
      <p>We use a personal goal attainment scale to help you, and us, to follow your progress.</p>
      <p>When setting this goal, currently on the sliding scale you should be at 0%, achieving the goal would be rated at 100%.</p>

      {{ form.slider("", "", 0, 100, 25, "%", "No confidence", "Complete confidence") }}

      <br>
      <p>Here are some potential examples that may help you to think of a goal that is important to you.</p>
      <ul class="special">
        <li>To be able to walk to my local post office confidently</li>
        <li>To return to playing tennis twice a week</li>
        <li>To be able to complete an hour of gardening without feeling tired</li>
        <li>To walk to the local park without needing to stop to rest</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Remember, it needs to be something that is achievable within the next 6 weeks and important to you.</p>
