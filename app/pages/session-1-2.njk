        <li>Start with gentle marching in the chair and then after 15 seconds, add in some punching with your arms for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Sit nice and tall and turn your head from side to side, looking over your right shoulder, stretch as far as is comfortable and hold for 5 seconds and then swap sides.</li>
        <li>Bring your right ear to your shoulder – try not to hitch your shoulder up, hold 5 seconds.</li>
        <li>Bring your chin to your chest, hold for 5 seconds and then look to the ceiling and hold for 5 seconds.</li>
        <li>Take your right arm and reach over your left shoulder, use your left arm to add a little stretch, hold for 5 seconds. Swap sides.</li>
        <li>Now reach with your right arm down your back, again use your left arm to add a little stretch, hold for 5 seconds. Now swap sides.</li>
        <li>Punch forwards for 10 seconds, up above your head for 10 seconds and out to the side for 10 seconds.</li>
        <li>Sit nice and tall in your chair and bring yourself forward, stretch out your right leg planting your heel. Lean forward until you feel a stretch in the back of your thigh, hold for 10 seconds. Now swap legs.</li>
        <li>Start heel and toe tapping, starting with your right foot for 20 seconds, then swap over to your left for 20 seconds.</li>
        <li>For the next 30 seconds stand up and sit down as many times as you are able to.</li>
        <li>Stand up behind you chair and practice going up and down on your heels, repeat 10 times.</li>
        <li>Standing tall, bring your right leg slowly out to the side, try not to let you toes point out to the side – they should be facing forwards, this is focusing on strengthening your hip. Repeat 10 times. Swap to your left leg and repeat.</li>
